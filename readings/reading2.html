      The examples at the beginning of the article about AI content on Instagram resonated with me a lot since
      I see so much of it on my feed, whether it's the animated cats stories, ASMR glass cutting, or the
      “choose your room” videos. These are often easy to spot, but outside of social media in places like the
      classroom or workplace, when you blend AI with human thought and effort, the line gets blurry. You can
      usually sense that something is off, but it's hard to put your finger on why. I like how the article used
      the word “expressiveness” as a new Turing Test that focuses on what people are capable of rather than
      computers. In art and writing, expressiveness means that a piece of work must have intention behind it
      that AI sometimes lacks. Prior to reading the article, I didn't really think about art as forming a
      relationship with the viewer and evoking some shared emotion. This requires knowing the context behind a
      piece of work, and thinking about art and writing as more than just pretty pictures and sentences makes
      the role of artists and writers feel a lot more meaningful. Ultimately, I like how the article reframed
      the issue of AI-generated content. Instead of simply hunting for signs of AI, it's freeing to instead ask
      if a piece is expressive and if it connects with the viewer.
