      I never really thought about restaurant websites as extensions of each restaurant's atmosphere, history,
      and identity, especially since I don't typically visit a restaurant's website now when I decide where to
      eat out. I usually use Google Maps and Beli, or I like to get recommendations directly from my friends.
      I agree with what Jasmine said in the interview about how restaurant websites are often “just parked to
      say, 'we exist in the world'” a lot, especially because many of the restaurant websites I do happen to
      visit are often outdated or have incomplete information about the menu. One of my biggest takeaways as
      things like Squarespace and other CMS platforms become more popular and accessible is that they're not
      necessarily a threat to authentic, expressive restaurant websites. The Dimes website is an example of
      this, as it has an “old web” feel but is still a Squarespace site. What that means is that CMS platforms
      may encourage homogeneity because of the standard templates available, but there is still room for
      creative freedom. Lastly, I think it's interesting how some of the restaurant websites linked in the
      article have changed their design from what is shown in the screenshots. I wonder if that's because the
      website has lost its personality and is now using a default, standard template, or if it's because the
      atmosphere and vibe of the restaurants themselves have changed.
