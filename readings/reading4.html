        <p><strong>What did you think about the essay? Did anything in particular resonate?</strong></p>
        <p>
          I resonated with the essay's idea that a website is a “shifting house” that has the power to “[set]
          the record straight.” I agree that individuals and not corporations need to be the ones to shape the
          future of the web. The web is valuable because many people contribute to it, and it would lose the
          diversity of information and sources if just a few corporations controlled everything. As someone
          who uses social media frequently, I recognize that the photos I post and the tone and language I use
          in my captions form my personal brand online. However, social media profiles are still pretty
          homogeneous across all users. Everyone's profiles show up in the same layout, and there's also a
          pressure to only post what you know other people will respond to positively, so people curate their
          lives around likable aesthetics, and someone's profile rarely tells the whole story. In contrast,
          you have a lot more control over how you want to present yourself through a personal website. I
          think this is why I see a lot of people who maintain profiles on platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub
          choose to build a separate personal portfolio website. These personal websites showcase a person's
          work in a more meaningful and personalized way. You have full control over what specific work you
          want to highlight, the layouts you use, and other stylistic elements you want to apply like colors,
          fonts, spacing, and more. So while social media is an important part of the web and does a good job
          of connecting people, you can use a personal website to tell a more authentic, deeper story about
          your work.

            >Laurel proposes a website could be a river, a garden, a thrown rock. If you have a website, what
            could your website be?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think my website would be a garden. I'm interested in the intersection of business, technology,
          and design, and all my work is rooted in these areas. My past projects and experience shape my
          future ones, and like a garden, my website would be a living ecosystem where I can document the
          process I use for each project and explain how my previous work inspires various choices I make in
          newer projects. Just as plants grow, I see my design style as growing and shifting over time.
          Expanding on this, I could also see my website being a kitchen or workshop of some sort because I
          could highlight current projects that are works-in-progress and ideas I have beyond any projects
          I've finished and wrapped up, and I'd be able to document my design and development process similar
          to how I could in the garden metaphor.

            >What can you do with a website that you make yourself that you can't do if someone else makes
            your website?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you make a website yourself, you have more control over the layouts, the content you present,
          and little details. You aren't influenced by another designer's interpretation of your vision, and
          you can structure the website around your unique thought process. You could easily decide to change
          the style of the cursor or scroll bar, add decorative elements, and add transitions and animations
          how you see fit without having to run it by someone else. In contrast, if your site is built by
          someone else, I think it's more likely to become a finished product, and you might have to pay to
          get it updated. There's more friction in that process than if you designed and built the whole
          website yourself.
